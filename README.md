# 🧩 Sliding Puzzle Game

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Sliding Puzzle Game** is a fully functional, interactive web application built using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The objective of the game is to arrange numbered tiles in the correct order by sliding them into an empty space using the minimum number of moves.

This project is designed as part of the **Web Dev II Final Project** and demonstrates strong fundamentals in **DOM manipulation**, **event-driven programming**, and **client-side state management**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Logic-based puzzle games help users improve problem-solving and analytical thinking skills. The goal of this project is to build a browser-based sliding puzzle that:
- Responds dynamically to user actions
- Maintains game state on the client side
- Provides meaningful feedback such as move count, game status, and best score

---

## ✨ Features Implemented
- 🔢 Dynamic sliding puzzle board generation
- 🎚️ Multiple difficulty levels:
  - Easy (3×3)
  - Hard (4×4)
- 🖱️ Click-based tile movement
- 🔄 Valid move checking (only adjacent tiles can move)
- 📊 Move counter
- 🏆 Best move score tracking
- 🕒 Game history logging
- 📢 Game status indicator (Started / Completed)
- 🔁 Reset and replay functionality

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts & Logic
- Puzzle tiles are generated dynamically using JavaScript
- Game state is stored and updated using arrays and objects
- Only tiles adjacent to the empty space are allowed to move
- The puzzle checks for completion after every move
- Best scores are stored using **LocalStorage** to persist data across sessions

---

## 🧩 DOM & JavaScript Concepts Used
- Dynamic DOM element creation and removal
- Event listeners for user interaction
- Conditional rendering based on game state
- State management using JavaScript arrays
- Style updates using JavaScript
- LocalStorage for data persistence

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Structure
- **CSS3** – Styling (Flexbox/Grid)
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** – Game logic and DOM manipulation

🚫 No external frameworks or libraries were used.
